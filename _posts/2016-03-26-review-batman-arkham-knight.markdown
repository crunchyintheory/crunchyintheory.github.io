Batman: Arkham Knight is an open-world action game developed by Rocksteady, published by Warner Brothers, and ported to PC by Iron Galaxy. This game is infamous for its atrocious launch, when it was riddled so much with bugs, frame rate locks, missing features, and general horrible performance that WB felt the need to pull it from shelves and encourage people to get refunds. Now, however, most of the bugs and issues have been ironed out, and it is definitely a fantastic game and an acceptable PC port. Please note that in this review I will be trying not to compare it to previous Arkham games, but I will be using Origins if I do.

# - Combat -

The game uses the FreeFlow combat system, as in the previous Arkham games, but this time with new Environmental Takedowns, enemy types, and general combat improvements over previous Arkham games. My main issue with the stealth system in previous games is that it is incredibly difficult, if not near-impossible, to effectively deal with a room full of armed enemies. In Arkham Knight, this issue is addressed by adding a multi-enemy takedown that is earned by pulling off Silent takedowns. The areas have more vertical depth, and you can enter grates from the vantage points. A new gadget, the Voice Synthesizer, allows you to actually order enemies around once you obtain it. The Disruptor has received a major buff as well, now having 4 shots total (after one upgrade), and it can disable even more weapons and environmental objects. The addition of automated turrets adds another layer of challenge in that you have to disable their sensors using the Remote Hacking Device and knock out all the enemies in 60 seconds before it comes back online and guns you down.

# - The Open World -

One of the strong points of this game is how good it feels to just move around the open world, be it in the Batmobile crushing through buildings and crowds of rioters as you zoom along the streets of Gotham, or flying amongst the tallest buildings and grappling you way to your goal, it just feels good. The Grapnel Accelerator has also received a buff, allowing you to boost yourself 5 times (after 3 upgrades), becoming insanely fast. It can be infuriating, however, to mash your space bar so much every time you grapple to a new location. The mandatory "Open-World-game-collectible-items" are here again in the form of, again, Riddler Trophies. Riddler Trophies will either take the form of items that you merely have to go to the right location to pick up, or rewards for completing puzzles. You can find the location of Riddler Trophies by interrogating Riddler Informants that will randomly spawn throughout Gotham. In previous Arkham games, you could actually take down the Riddler Informant and still interrogate him afterwards, but in Arkham Knight you must keep them alive, which can get infuriating pretty quickly.

Gotham is divided into three islands, Founders Island (The hardest), Miagani Island, and Bleake Island (The easiest). You start out on Bleake Island, but can fly to the other islands any time you wish. You cannot, however, drive the Batmobile to the other islands until you lower the bridges at some point in the main story quest. Each island has a "threat level", which denotes how many drone tanks/checkpoints/watchtowers/quadcopters the main enemy has remaining on each island.

# - The Batmobile -

The Batmobile is Batman's personal car that you can drive around almost at your leisure. At almost any point in the game, you can press a button when looking at a street and the Batmobile will be summoned to your location. The Batmobile can also turn into a maneuverable tank by holding RMB, in which mode you are armed with Riot Suppressors (nonlethal rounds), two Vulkan guns, and a 60mm cannon. As the story progresses, you are given more secondary weapons, which you can use after charge is build up by blowing up more tanks in the Batmobile.

I like the Batmobile, I really do. However, the game forces you to use it waaaay too much for my taste, and it starts to feel a bit weird the more you use it. First off, let's just point out that Gotham's streets are full of objects. Boxes, walls, pillars, even those portable toilet things are lining the streets in Arkham Knight. Instead of having these objects as permanent obstructions to the Batmobile, Rocksteady opted to make almost all of these objects destructible with either your twin machine guns, 60mm cannon, or just by rolling over them. This kind of goes against Batman's motto somewhat, as he's incurring enough property damage to probably collapse a building on some poor crowd who went to the "Prometheus Academy of Running Away from Things." On top of that, it just feels like...everything is made of weak foam. There's very little resistance on anything, even solid concrete pillars supporting buildings. It creates this weird feeling of non-substance on the car, something that you never want when designing a driving mode.

# - Graphics & Performance -

Let's face it, it's not a perfect PC port by any means. It will drop to 45 frames per second in some areas. The GameWorks smoke WILL destroy your framerate whenever you rev up the Batmobile. However, I ran with these settings:

and had an overall amazing graphical experience that is well suited to a modern AAA title. The GameWorks Smoke & Fog effect is an absolute waste, So I turned it off immediately, but the other effects actually look quite good and don't have much of a performance hit as far as I could tell.

The game just looks...amazing. By far one of the best looking games ever released, it boasts excellent lighting, wetness effects, reflections, the best rain I've ever seen, particle effects, and cloth on Batman's cape. I have to criticize their off-looking skin effects, however. It's almost as if it's trying to be SubSurface Scattering, but isn't quite there. Nevertheless, it looks great and it runs fairly well on my system (i7 4790k/GTX 970).

At launch, there was a controversy over the PC version missing wetness textures, but I can assure you that they're present now.

# - The Story -

The story revolves around the Arkham Knight, a mysterious masked villain who's out for revenge on Batman, and Scarecrow. The Knight is actually a new character created exclusively for this game, which is failrly uncommon to see in a DC game. I won't spoil the specifics of the plot twist here, but Scarecrow has threatened Gotham with his new batch of fear toxin, and Gotham is evacuated, leaving the Arkham Knight's militia to take control of the city.

I've never really felt intimidated by Scarecrow as a main villain up until now, he's always been just that guy who wears a bag on his head. In Arkham Knight, however, a combination of his redesign and his fantastic voice acting by John Noble (I just have to mention it) creates a genuinely fear-inducing antagonist. In fact, all the characters are very well voice acted.

Overall, the story is very well written and touches on the different characters for just the right amount of time before moving on. Almost every mission feels unique, and they all tie together very nicely.

# - Conclusion -

I would talk more about this game, but the character limit is cutting me a bit short here. Overall, Arkham Knight has fantastic combat, graphics, and story, and overall great side activities and open world. I've explored every inch of this Gotham, and I encourage you to do so as well.

# Final Verdict: 8.5/10 - Fantastic but with a few flaws
