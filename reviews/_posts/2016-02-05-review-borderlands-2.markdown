snippet: "Borderlands 2 is a first person looter shooter developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It was ported to Mac & Linux by Aspyr. This is by far my favorite game ever; I love it wholeheartedly. It's crazy, but a perfect level to where it's not boring; it's comedic, but still manages to deliver a moving story. I definitely think that, if you haven't played this game, you should play it now and grab the DLC while you're at it."

Borderlands 2 is a first person looter shooter developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It was ported to Mac & Linux by Aspyr. This is by far my favorite game ever; I love it wholeheartedly. It's crazy, but a perfect level to where it's not boring; it's comedic, but still manages to deliver a moving story. I definitely think that, if you haven't played this game, you should play it now and grab the DLC while you're at it.

# - Combat & Weapons -

The combat in Borderlands 2 is incredibly simple at first. Shoot everything without a green health bar. Or sometimes those too. It develops complexity, however, when you gain access to elemental weaponry; these come in the form of fire, shock, corrosive, and slag. The first three deal enhanced damage to a specific type of health (fire to flesh, shock to shields, and corrosive to armor), and slag causes enemies to take more damage from other elemental types. This system works because you can easily opt to use regular ballistic weaponry and not have to worry about it, or use elemental weaponry and deal vastly enhanced damage.

Each weapon has specific characteristics that make it unique. Rarity, level, parts, type, and manufacturer all play their part in making each weapon different. The Rarity influences the skin it will use, as well as enhancing all stats; the level will multiply all stats to make it applicable at high level; the parts will provide stat enhancements to specific stats, as well as visibly changing the weapon's model; the weapon type (assault rifle, SMG, sniper, pistol, shotgun, etc.); the manufacturer will add a special trait to the weapon (ex. Dahl weapons burst fire when zoomed). There's a whole lot of depth to be found here, but it's still very approachable if you don't want to mess with this stuff.

The amount of variety found in weapons greatly adds to the replayability of the game.

# - The Story -

The story of Borderlands 2 is actually one of the high points of this game, something you wouldn't expect from one of these ultra-violent looter shooter games. It focuses on a Vault Hunter, your character, striving to find an ancient alien vault filled with loot hidden away on Pandora, a savage planet filled with vile creatures and vicious raiders. The Hyperion Corporation, led by maniacal antagonist Handsome Jack, is also searching for the vault, and seeks to harness its power to restore Pandora by killing everyone on it.

Borderlands 2 manages that perfect mix of comedy and seriousness that makes the story that much more immersive and believable. The characters, both returning from the first game and new to this one, are unforgettable, as is most of the rest of the game. There's fantastic writing paired with character depth and fantastic voice acting.

# - Characters & Customization -

Another strong point of Borderlands 2 is how great the character customization is. You can pick between more heads and body colorings than you can count, and you have four weapon slots in which to equip guns simultaneously. Each class has their own head customizations, skill trees, and action skills. Each class has 3 skill trees (you aren't limited to one at a time) that each have their own focus. When playing in co-op, the classes work together really well, proving how much time and thought went into tailoring these skills.

# - The World -

Most of the levels look completely different from each other, and I could probably tell you which level you were showing me from a small screenshot of it. Almost every level has an easter egg of some sort, ranging from the whole Minecraft area filled with blocks and Creepers found in the Caustic Caverns to the "Rakkman Forever" or "R.O.U.S." enemies found in The Fridge. They aren't just "haha memes" easter eggs, they're incorporated into the world and used at just the right frequency to make them enjoyable instead of annoying. There'll always be one small detail that I notice every time I come back to a level. Some kind of secret treasure room or hidden vault symbol will always be there.

Each enemy faction feels unique, and you have to fight each one differently. For instance, Loaders will largely just charge you, but Rats and some Hyperion soldiers will try to use cover and distance wisely.

# - Graphics & Performance -

The Borderlands series has a unique visual style found in both lighting and textures. It's not the best lighting or the highest resolution textures to be found out there, but it's still visually pleasing because of its consistent art style. However, the PC version has a great options menu along with fantastic performance. One gripe is that PhysX seems to be a lot less optimized than the implementation found in The Pre-Sequel!. Another is that the game only features SSAO and FXAA, but you can inject SMAA using ReShade or force MSAA from your graphics control panel. You can also implement HBAO+ as shown in a guide I've written for the game on Steam.

something that is not usually possible. Part of the visual style, I think, is the lack of material shaders, making everything look like it was drawn on a piece of paper and then glued to the model. The comical cel shading effect makes this visual style work, where normally it would be atrocious.

# - Conclusion -

Please buy this game. It's an amazing looting experience backed up by a fantastic story and great character customization, making it enjoyable even by your fifth playthrough. Even the DLC is good! It's well optimized, it's not the most graphically advanced game but it still looks great, and the menus are well designed. Even if you don't play the co-op game in co-op mode, it's still very enjoyable and well-balanced.

# Final Verdict: 9.5/10 - Utterly Amazing
