Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is one of the four campaign DLCs made for Borderlands 2. It was developed by Gearbox Software, the developers of the base game.

It follows a DnD-esque board game being played by Lilith, Brick, Mordecai, and Tina as the Dungeon Master. You play one of the pieces on the table, battling dragons and other fantastical creatures as the world changes around you at the whim of Tina and the others. The world is really thematic while maintaining the same Borderlands feel of the base game.

The story is a very cliche DnD game story, rescue a princess from the evil wizard who's corrupting the land. At the same time, though, you can still hear the characters talking as they play the board game, and you can hear the real plot of <span class="spoiler">Tina's denial of Roland's death, and the other characters' attempts to get her to cope with it.</span> Characters from the base game make an appearance, some in their normal forms and others as part of the game world. All the vending machines have been spruced up with stained glass renditions of their Pandoran counterparts. One tiny anomaly that I noticed is that the reflections in the water of Flamerock Refuge are reflections of Sanctuary's buildings. Whether or not this is intentional is up to speculation. I love how it's constantly making references to other fantasy games or other media, and there's even one quest where you have to troll some other 'players' who are waiting for a mob to respawn into leaving.

The DLC weapons are also very good, and there's actually a whole new rarity, Gemstone, that takes its place as just a bit better than purple-rarity. The Magic Missile grenade mods, namely, are some of the best in the game as they allow you to regenerate grenade ammo while they're equipped.

# Final Verdict: 9/10 - Amazing
