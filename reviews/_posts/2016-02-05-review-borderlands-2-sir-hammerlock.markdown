Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is a piece of DLC for Borderlands 2 that was outsourced by 2K. It follows the adventures of the refined Sir Hammerlock's adventure through a hunting retreat with your player character. This is one of the four Campaign DLCs for Borderlands 2.

This DLC takes place in an insect and primitive tribe filled swamp, and they've chosen to accentuate this by placing a horrible green filter over everything. All the sub areas in this DLC look almost exactly the same, all with the ugly green filter. There's very little of the hallmark secret areas or easter eggs to be found in this DLC, making the levels uninteresting and bland. 

The story basically centers around Professor Nakayama, who hijacks your hunting to tell you <span class="spoiler"> that he's created a clone of Handsome Jack, and tries to entice you to seek him out. </span> The story is overall very mundane and not well written at all, though I did enjoy <span class="spoiler"> Claptrap being revered as a god a-la-C-3P0 </span>

My major complaint with this DLC is actually the balancing and pacing of enemies. All the enemies are complete bullet sponges, and the witch doctors are downright unfair even in Normal Vault Hunter Mode. The giant floating spores are the most annoying enemies to deal with in the entire game, as they too are bullet sponges. Badass Savages can even be evolved by the Witch Doctors, finally resulting in a form that can only be taken down by fifteen successive point blank Norfleet shots. You'll even struggle and probably die several times to the first group of enemies in the DLC.

This DLC does, however, include Voracidous the Invincible, a raid boss and actually a pretty fun and challenging one. All of the DLC weapons, however, are anything but useful and inventive. Mainly, they're just slower and lower damage versions of base game weapons.

# Final Verdict: 3/10 - Terrible, but with one or two redeeming qualities
