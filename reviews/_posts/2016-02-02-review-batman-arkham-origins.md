Batman: Arkham Origins is an open world action game developed by WB Games Montreal and Splash Damage and published by Warner Brothers. To my knowledge, it was also ported to PC by WB Montreal and Splash Damage. For some reason, Batman games just can't catch a solid break on PC, at least not at launch, but this game clearly suffers far worse than the rest of them. I personally didn't feel compelled to write this review until I went back to this game after completing Arkham Knight, the next game in the series, and realized many things about this game that I hadn't seen before. WB publicly announced, shortly after this game's launch, that they wouldn't be fixing any non-game-breaking bugs in order to develop more DLC for the product. As a result, the game remains bug-filled far after its launch.

# - Combat -

The game uses the FreeFlow combat system, as in the previous Arkham games, but with a few new added features. A major gripe I have with this game in particular is the incredibly low time to counter given to counter some enemies attacks, sometimes less than a second. This would not be a problem necessarily on a rare, extremely difficult enemy, but this can appear even on the first enemies of the game. I talked about the stealth system in this game in [my review of Arkham Knight][arkhamknightreview], but I'd like to talk about it in greater detail here. Dealing with armed enemies is *incredibly* infuriating because, in most areas, the only avenues of efficient movement consist of the gargoyles mounted on the walls, usually one on each wall of a square/rectangular room. There are also floor grates placed under certain areas, but they are very restricting and often don't allow for many tactical takedown opportunities. The Disruptor, a weapon capable of disabling weapons and any enemy armaments, only has three charges (after one late-game upgrade), and the effect is lost after a few seconds. Enemies have very annoying AI in some areas, in that they will not give you any chance to enter or leave the floor grates. There are very few areas in which you can siphon away individual enemies, rendering most "takedown fodder" locations pointless. You get a total of one smoke pellet which recharges every 30 minutes; this is probably one of the only ways you can take down large groups of armed enemies.

# - The Open World -

The majority of the open world activities in Arkham Origins consist of, again, Riddler Trophies . My complaint with this system is that most of the 'extortion data packs' are locked behind some sort of gadget-wall, be it a generator that you have to power with the shock gloves, or a pipe bursting with hot steam that you have to seal with the glue grenade. The reason this is annoying is that this is often the only 'puzzle' element to these datapacks, and it's just there to make you go back to them later.

There are also the "most wanted" missions, in which you track down Gotham's most wanted criminals through a series of objectives. These are, more often than not, uninteresting chores that aren't very motivating. Also, I don't know if this was a bug or not, but I wasn't even aware of the *existence* of Bird's most wanted until I happened upon the group of thugs that apparently starts the mission. Black Mask's most wanted also doesn't appear to be listed on the most wanted page for me, preventing me from tracking my progress.

The problem with Arkham Origin's open world in general is that all of the areas blend together and have no individuality whatsoever. I didn't feel motivated to explore the world, and I didn't feel rewarded for doing so as there's very little of import or interest to be found there. It's all so very empty, and you move so slowly across it as well.

# - Graphics, Performance & Configuration -

This section is probably going to be where the review gets a little more positive, as graphics and performance is good overall for a 2013 title. It's not nearly as pretty as the Steam Store screenshots would have you believe, but it's not a bad looking game by any stretch of the word. I ran the game on max settings save Motion Blur (off) and Ambient Occlusion (very high), and had no significant frame rate drops on my system (i7 4790k, GTX 970). The quality of the lighting is probably the least strong point, and it's shamefully bad in the outdoor areas. Texture quality is relatively poor, as to be expected, along with general material/shader quality. The GameWorks snow, smoke, and paper effects are very good looking (I could probably live without the paper) and perform quite well, and the DX11 tessellation on ground snow is the best looking part of the game. Effects like fire and bloom can be somewhat dire; overall the game is better looking indoors than outdoors. Sound quality, surprisingly, can actually be horrible in some instances, especially in background sounds.

The graphics settings are acceptable, but the other settings are sadly not. Field of View is unchangeable, leaving some with a horribly narrow camera angle. There is no available Borderless Windowed mode, Anisotropic Filtering, and SMAA is not available. The game suffers a random stutter whenever you interact with most objects in the world, which will become annoying over time.

Also, what's the deal with the pre-rendered cutscenes in this game? I get pre-rendered cutscenes in games, I really do, but not when they're compressed at the same bitrate as my livestreams, run at thirty frames per second, and they even look worse than the in-engine ones, I have a hard time defending them. Especially considering that they're literally everywhere in this game,

# - The Story -

The story consists of Batman being hunted by assassins sent by Black Mask <span class="spoiler">err..I mean Joker</span>, and is a prequel to Arkham Asylum. The lack of a compelling story is a major problem with this game. It's all very cliche, and I even thought that it was over at some points until I consulted the most wanted screen. Most of the voice actors lack good delivery on their lines, and it's not particularly well-written either. Part of the problem is how little the most wanted missions tie-in with the main story, so you won't even realize that they're there until you play the next game and realize that there are side quests.

# - Conclusion -

I have to give props to this game for introducing me to the Arkham series and Batman in general. I've never been a huge Batman fan, but I certainly appreciate the story of the Caped Crusader more after playing this game. It looks pretty good, it runs fairly well, but the world is lackluster and the story is too. Oh yeah, you'll also be pestered by a bug every few seconds, and Batman will somehow self-levitate 1/20 times you start flying.

If you can take the bugs, it's a fun game for running around as Batman and beating people up.

# Final Verdict: 6/10 - Good, but lacking in some areas.
