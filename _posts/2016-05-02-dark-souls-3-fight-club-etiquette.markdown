Dark Souls 3 has pretty much consumed my life since it came out, and I'm happy to say that it was as good as I hoped it would be. The PvP is as lively as ever, and you're more than likely to run in to at least a few fight clubs along your way. These organized arena duels have an unspoken code of ethics to them, so I am here to impart that knowledge to you.

#Finding your local fight club

Easily the best location to find fight clubs is the first bonfire in the first area of the game <span class="spoiler">High Wall of Lothric</span> in New Game Plus. This area won't be very populated in NG, so bear that in mind.

If you're not quite ready to tackle NG+, you can also find fight clubs at the bonfire directly after the <span class="spoiler">Pontiff Sulyvhan</span> boss fight. That area will be populated in both NG and NG+.

#Items to help you out

The *most* important item as a host is the **Dried Finger**. This is sold by the Shrine Handmaid for only a couple thousand souls, and lets you summon up to five red phantoms if you haven't killed the area boss. It's best to host if you haven't killed the boss yet, as your phantom cap will be raised from two to five (with the finger). Another useful Item is the **Prism Stone**, also sold by the Shrine handmaid for only a few souls a piece. You'll need as much of these as you can carry, and you can use them to mark out an arena for your competitors to fight in. This is one of the easiest ways to let your summons know they've entered into a fight club.

#Etiquette as a Phantom

Red sign soapstones are your best bet for getting in to a fight club. You will spawn in a distant part of the map, and you should try to make your way back to where you put your sign down. If there's nobody there, it's probably not a fight club and you can proceed however you want. You can tell if you've stumbled upon a fight club by what the host is wearing, and whether or not there are other red phantoms sitting next to themselves/the host. If there is already a duel in progress, it's best to make your way to the spectating area. If not, you can stand in the middle and await a challenger.

During the duel, there are also a few rules that you will be expected to observe. First and foremost, you should never heal. Healing will most likely get you killed by the host and every other phantom there. Needless to say, it's not worth it. If you should defeat your opponent, you should bow and await the next challenger. Running away from a fight club is never respectful, and will get you killed as well as seem like a complete ass.

When it's your turn to fight, don't hesitate to jump down into the ring. You've got nothing to lose, and it is what you signed up for after all.

#Etiquette as a Host

Keep summoning phantoms. Try not to summon white phantoms or sunbros, as they usually aren't looking for a fight club. Just sit down in the spectator area and try not to get in the middle of fights. If someone attacks you, make sure to let everyone in your world know that they should kill that person. If you see a phantom healing during a duel (it's acceptable after a duel), you can kill them if you want or just let the duel play out. It is your club, after all.

We Blades of the Darkmoon really appreciate it when you equip the Way of the Blue when hosting, as it helps us farm those tough-to-obtain **Proof of a Concord Kepts**.

#Some last notes

Please refrain from estoc spamming (at least until it's fixed), and parry/backstab phishing are, while usually allowed, not usually appreciated. Don't try to bait your competitors into traps, and don't kill them while they're dueling unless they break a rule.

If you're a spectator, don't be afraid to use the **Call out** gesture to jeer and the **Applause** gesture to, well, applaud. There's nothing better than defeating an opponent after a long duel and seeing the spectators bowing and applauding. 

#That's about it!

Go out there and host some fight clubs, or even enter into one to test your mettle against other players!
