*Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor* is an open-world action game developed by Monolith Productions, published by Warner Bros. on Windows, and ported & published on OSX and Linux by Feral Interactive. The *Lord of the Rings* franchise has had a rather multifarious history when it comes to video games, but it has fared better than some other, less fortunate franchises. *Mordor* is probably the best *Lord of the Rings* game I've played in a long time. *Mordor* takes place in, as you may have guessed, Mordor. You walk the footsteps of the Ranger, Talion, whose family was slaughtered by the Black Hand of Sauron while stationed upon the Black Gate of Mordor.

# - Story -

*Mordor*'s story revolves around Talion's thirst for revenge on the Black Hand of Sauron, who slaughtered his family and seek to usher in a new Uruk rule over Mordor. Throughout the game you will be presented with only a few side characters, which I feel helps sell the sense of emptiness and solitude that the settings provides. Your one true companion is a wraith known as Celebrimbor, who brought you back from the brink of death after being sacrificed by the Black Hand in the beginning of the game. He tells you that your fates are intertwined, and the only way to die peacefully is to hunt down and slay the Black Hand. Celebrimbor's history is not known to you, and you will find out who he is through flashbacks found at regular intervals during the story.

The story is quite well presented, but I feel that it was rushed somewhat toward the end, and it throws a whole ton of stuff at you all at once.

# - Combat & Stealth -

  If I had to describe *Mordor* briefly, it would be the *Arkham* (Rocksteady's signature and successful string of Batman games) series crossed with the *Assassin's Creed* Series (Ubisoft's series of parkour-oriented stealth games). *Mordor* combines the bouncy, dance-like combat of the *Arkham* games with the great range of vertical movement offered by the *Assassin's Creed* games. These systems, combined with *Mordor*'s own stealth mechanic work very well.

  The combat system, as I mentioned earlier, is based on the Free-Flow combat system employed in the *Arkham* series. The major distinction lies in your ability to use the wraith abilities of your incorporeal counterpart, Celebrimbor. You are now able to control the battlefield by possessing your enemies, and turning them to your side. This mechanic is introduced rather late in the game, which surprised me somewhat, but it really adds a lot to the game once it is finally introduced. His wraith powers are also used to explain some of the borrowed Free-Flow mechanics, all of which you will recognized if you've played any of the *Arkham* games.

  At any point, you can also draw a bow which fires wraith arrows and slows down time when equipped. The slow time effect can be turned off and consumes Focus, which is exclusively used to power this effect. The arrow capacity is not great, although it can be expanded upon with upgrades. Normally, I would complain about not having a plentiful supply of arrows at all times, but I will make an exception in *Mordor*'s case. When you brand or drain an enemy (the afformentioned possession), you will regain a fair amount of arrows and some health if you are equipped with the appropriate runes. Arrow pickups are also scattered liberally throughout the entire world, so arrows were rarely ever a problem for me, unlike *Crysis 3*'s pathetic nine arrow maximum.

  In stealth encounters, you are presented with many methods of attack. You can climb to the rooftops, or rather the crumbling remains of rooftops, to jump down upon your enemies and take them by surprise. Alternatively, you can use foliage like thick bushes to hide from your enemies and really mess up their ankles or something. One of my problems with the stealth in *Mordor* is that enemies always seem to be in a perpetual state of awareness of your location after they are alerted to you, even if you escape to somewhere they couldn't possibly have seen you. Another gripe is that *Mordor* seems to love placing huge crowds of Uruks in areas where it wants me to use stealth. I can't be expected to fight over twenty well-armed, shielded Uruks with archer support at once!? Overall, though, the stealth is solid and pretty fun once you unlock the possession ability.

  There are also various environmental opportunities, such as freeing Caragors from their cages, dropping Morgai fly nests to horrify enemies (as well they should be), or igniting campfires and those pesky explosive barrels that seem to permeate every video game in existence.

# - The World -

  The World of *Mordor* consists of two maps, the bleak and desolate Mordor, and the fertile steppes of Núrn. Both Mordor and Núrn have very similar layouts, and it pretty much feels like Núrn is Mordor but with grass (although it does have more plateaus). The meaningless collectible items are in this game, this time taking the form of Pentagon shaped icon and Dagger shaped icon. Neither will advance the story or your collection of Uruk heads, so there's little point in collecting them except completion. Uruks hold fortresses in both locations, which serve as dangerous and challenging locations where you will encounter tougher Uruks known as Captains.

  The biggest thing separating *Mordor* from other games is the "Sauron's Army" system. Essentially, you are presented with a hierarchy comprised of Captains and their higher-ups, Warchiefs. Every Captain has a set of weaknesses and strengths; some will have poisoned weapons or be able to block attempts to vault over them, but they may also be instantly killable with a Headshot or perhaps a stealth finisher. Captains will also host events for their soldiers, and these present an easy opportunity to eliminate them or increase their power. Captains will also start rivalries with other Captains, allowing you to manipulate Sauron's Army to your advantage. Later in the game, once you unlock the ability to possess enemies, you can even take control of Captains and command them to attack their peers or betray their Warchief if they happen to be a bodyguard. This system is incredibly well done and adds a ton of variety to the game.

  Two times during the game, the story will be 'put on hold' and the game will demand that you Assassinate all of the Warchiefs. In my opinion, it would have been better if you had gone through the story and taken out each Warchief one at a time, broken up by another mission or two inbetween. These are the low points of the story, and it's important to get past these and to the interesting bits.

# - Graphics & Performance -

  *Shadow of Mordor* isn't the best looking game I've ever played, but it certainly has some very pretty visuals. I feel compelled to use the expression "you can't polish a turd" here, because Mordor's (the area, not the game) flat and very bare layout is hard to make look good, but I feel that *Mordor* has done it very well. Every game has its bad graphical facet, and *Mordor*'s is its grass effects. Unfortunately, grass is very prevalent in the land of Núrn, where you progress later in the game. However, the game does run quite well, with all settings at their maximum save Ambient Occlusion (1 down from max) and Mesh quality (1 down from max). There's hardly a visual difference in those settings, and the game has maintained a very comfortable 60fps on my 4790k/970 setup. I have even installed the Ultra texture pack, which claims on its store page to require a minimum of 6GB of VRAM (not true at all). I must, however, complain about two things with the PC port. One is its ludicrous AntiAliasing support. The game only supports FXAA in its inbuilt options menu, and I was not able to use any third-party utilities like ReShade or even NVCP to force AA. Second is its odd issue of having Mouse Sensitivity tied to the Frame rate, which makes the mouse movement very slow on certain configurations. I eventually resigned to playing with a controller, but it is still an issue I feel I must mention.

# - Conclusion -

  In conclusion, *Shadow of Mordor* is a very good *LoTR* game and sports some individuality so frequently overlooked in the games industry. Beast riding, while a solid method for travelling and attacking Uruk in certain scenarios, does feel a tad tacked-on and isn't a very fluid experience for me. I'd highly recommend this game to any *LoTR* fan, or a fan of the *Arkham* or *Assassin's Creed* series. I obtained the Game of the Year Edition (the only version availible on steam at the time of writing) and got *all* of the DLC included (reviews of which I will also write).

# Final Verdict: 8/10 - Very Solid
