**For convenience in this review, the first Dark Souls game will be referred to as *Dark Souls I*, not *Dark Souls*. *Dark Souls III* may also be shortened to simply *DSIII* for simplicity.**

*Dark Souls III*, the game I've been waiting for since I first played *Dark Souls I*. The first one was enjoyable for me, but critically flawed on PC and thus reduced my overall enjoyment of it. *Dark Souls II* did not follow in the footsteps of its predecessor when it came to its PC port, but its combat was lacking compared to *Dark Souls I*. *Dark Souls III* takes the things I enjoyed from I and II and combines them into a masterful game, quite easily taking Borderlands 2's place as my favorite game. Its combat is thrilling, its environments beautiful, and its story deep and engaging. Most of the issues I discuss in this review will actually be related to multiplayer and patching.

# - Gameplay -

*Dark Souls III* is less inspired by *Dark Souls II* and more so by *Dark Souls I* in terms of combat. It returns to the agile and punishing combat I felt was somewhat lost in *Dark Souls II*, but it still manages to take to heart what *Dark Souls II* did well. Equipment slots are boosted to three instead of two and there are four ring slots instead of only two. The torch has made a return from *Dark Souls II*, but this time there is no timer, giving it infinite usage. I found myself ditching it after a while, however, as I didn't have enough space for it in my equipment slots (between a medium shield, parrying shield, and staff). Enemy attacks feel like they are from Bloodborne in terms of speed, making parrying enemies a lot harder than it was in *Dark Souls I*.

Bosses are very well designed for the most part (a few exceptions being <span class="spoiler">High Lord Wolnir, Yhorm the Giant, and Ancient Wyvern</span>). Most are very challening, while others are suprisingly easy especially if you can exploit their weakness. For example, the tutorial boss can be very challenging for new players but becomes very easy if you can parry his first phase and use firebombs during his second phase.

A major addition to the game's combat is Weapon Arts. Most weapons have one, and they will either enable a special moveset or execute a unique attack depending on the weapon. These abilities cost FP (a new resource to keep track of) and stamina and some are more effective than others. Some are incredibly powerful in PvE, while others are incredibly powerful in PvE. Overall, I'd say these abilities add variety to the game.

Magic is not very powerful in *DSIII*, especially Faith spells. Cast times are long, damage is low, and miracles are incredibly hard to obtain. This really put a damper on my character, as I typically run a mixed knight/sorcerer build and I found myself not having the damage output required to justify using my spells towards the end of the game. Magic has been a huge part of Dark Souls ever since the first game, and this rebalance of spells is definitely to the detriment of *Dark Souls III*. If you plan on making a dedicated sorcerer build, or you were hoping to bust out the 'ole *Dark Souls II* hexes again, be warned of this.

# - Multiplayer -

I had better get this part over with. *Dark Souls III* has massive problems when you want to play online, most of which are server problems and issues with developer behavior. Connectivity is shoddy at times, and sometimes you'll find yourself battling against 56k modem in PvP. The most severe issue, however, is how the game handles cheaters or even suspected cheaters. If the FROM/Namco server team deems you a hacker, your account will be shadowbanned almost immediately. This has led to many an innocent player being banned and many hackers getting along without a scratch. This was actually an incredibly scary thing in one patch, where a malicious player could actually mod your stats by hitting you with their weapon, resulting in your account getting banned unless you delete or restore your save file from a backup.

PvP is very similar to previous games; you can invade using the red eye orb (which is readily accessible this time; no covenant restrictions) or use the red sign soapstone to be summoned to another world. Lag contributes to a lot of frustration in PvP, allowing other players to hit you from miles away. The poise stat, which is supposed to influence how many hits you can take without being staggered, is completely disabled in the game's code, despite the stat still being displayed and FROM/Bandai stating that it is "working as intended and is not 'turned off'". Poise would normally prevent two-shot weapons from stunlocking you into oblivion and would also make fast weapons less abusable.

Co-op is largely the same as in previous games, so there's nothing to worry about there. You can summon other players through a white summon sign, and you can optionally join the Sunbro covenant to increase the likelihood of being summoned.

All types of summons retain their Estus Flasks, healing items, but they are reduced to half when they are summoned. I wish they had gone the *Dark Souls II* route, where players had to use healing spells and use strategy in order to get their health back. Players that you're dueling, especially if you are going up against gankers, will just chug their Estus like crazy. You'll find yourself in this situation many times, and sometimes the only thing you can do is jump off a cliff and try to find another duel.

# - Weapons & Armor -

There is a great variety of weapons in *Dark Souls III*, but you'll only see other players in PvP using more than a few of them. Upgrading is done via Titanite, of which there is thankfully only one variety. Unique weapons are upgraded using Twinkling Titanite, dropped by passive Crystal Lizards. Boss weapons, however, are upgraded with Titanite Scales, dropped by the monstrous, mutated Crystal Lizards. My main issue with this system is that it makes trying out new weapons, maybe those that I wouldn't normally use, impossible unless I'm in the early stages of the game or I start a new character.

I feel like the armor in *Dark Souls III* is found in much lower quantity than in previous games, but there is an upside. You don't have to level up your armor anymore, so that means you can swap to different armor at any point for some extra Fashion Souls. It makes sense that weapons are still tied to upgrading, but I wish it were done differently.

# - Graphics & Performance -

*Dark Souls III* is beautiful, despite it not being the most technically impressive game of the year. Performance was very good on max settings on my machine (i7 4790k/GTX 970/16 GB RAM), but there have been some issues introduced with patches. On launch day, there was no hint of microstutter, but it was introduced in a patch later on. Even though it ended up being fixed, it's baffling that the patch was released in that state in the first place.

Evidently, support for 21:9 and multi-screen display schemes is not present, resulting in black bars on either side of the screen. This issue is being addressed by a third-party mod, [Souls Un-Squeezed][soulsunsqueezed]. Disclaimer: this mod edits game files, so this might get you banned. The frame rate is also capped at 60fps, so 120 or 144hz users are giong to have a rough time. The graphics menu is also fairly good, but Antialiasing is bound, once again, to an "on/off" setting. The AA is also very strange; I'm not sure exactly what implementation they're using.

# - Conclusion - 

*Dark Souls III* presents a challenging, beautiful, and immersive experience with a fantastic story and lore. Each boss has character and they're all varied and difficult in their own way. Despite its online issues, mutiplayer is fun and engaging and will surely maintain a community for many years to come.

#Final Verdict: 9.5/10 - Utterly Amazing
